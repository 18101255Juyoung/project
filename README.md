This is an my Robot detect program
========================


My name is Joo-Young Lee, in the 18th grade, currently attending [Seoul National University](https://www.seoultech.ac.kr/).

I would like to explain my :robot: robot detection program.

*1.When you first run the program, the image is displayed.*
**remember the image**

*2.When you remember, click the image window and press any key.*

*3.Exit the window by answering the correct questions.*

*4.This concludes my program.*

I made such a program, but I was actually studying deep learning,and I tried it once to see if I could make a Discord authentication program similar to the image below.
